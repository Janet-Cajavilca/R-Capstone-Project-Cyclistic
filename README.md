# Capstone Project Cyclistic


## Introduction 

In this case study, I performed the tasks of a junior data analyst. This project was undertaken to fulfill the requirements of the Google Data Analytics Capstone from the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course on Coursera.](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics?)

The work is for the fictional company, Cyclistic. I was assigned to answer the question: **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclist bikes differently?**
To answer the key business question, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: *ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.*

I have produced a report using R with the following deliverables:
- A clear statement of the task
- A description of all data sources used
- Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
- A summary of the analysis
- Supporting visualizations and key findings
- Recommendations based on the analysis
  
For the data analysis, I decided to use R because the data is too large for Google Spreadsheets or Microsoft Excel.
